## TODO list

- [ ] Full train and test pipeline 😛. I don't have a GPU for such a task so if anyone would like to lend me a GPU or try to do it themselves and give feedback and results I would be delighted 👌.
- [ ] Make documentation better
- [ ] Add package and dependency manager [pdm](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm)
- [ ] Check [jaxtyping](https://github.com/google/jaxtyping) if it time and memmory optimize. If yes I think it would be great to add it.
- [ ] Make more tests to make coverage test percentage higher 😏
- [ ] Test distributed learning
- [ ] Add pip deployment
- [ ] Add hugging face deployment
